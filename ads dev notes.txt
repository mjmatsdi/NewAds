When first starting the dev vm
-load eHub plc project - do NOT activate it or put it in RUN mode.
-run the NewAds console app
-result:
    Ads Error: 1 : [AdsClient:TwinCAT.Ads.Internal.INotificationReceiver.OnNotificationError()] 
    Exception: Couldn't register for AdsState change Notifications on the connected ADS Server. 
    Don't register for AdsClient.AdsStateChanged events! (Target port could not be found. 
    (AdsErrorCode: 6, 0x6))
    ...
    Exception thrown: 'TwinCAT.Ads.AdsErrorException' in TwinCAT.Ads.dll
    The program '[6684] NewAds.exe' has exited with code 0 (0x0).

the first part (Ads Error 1...) did not throw an exception when I stepped thru the code.
The exception was thrown when I hit the "client.AddDeviceNotification("vMessages.Msgs_SCP.Ready",..." 
code.


Try again with some code re-shuffling and a new invl;aid notificatyion handler
When first starting the dev vm
-load eHub plc project - do NOT activate it or put it in RUN mode.
-run the NewAds console app
-result: on the line where I ask for the Ads state (client.ReadState().AdsState) it throws
    Exception thrown: 'TwinCAT.Ads.AdsErrorException' in TwinCAT.Ads.dll
    Target port could not be found.
reading the ads state occurs immediately after the Ads.Connect call

repeating the above but activating the project and loading it and running it, I don't get that
"Don't register for AdsClient.AdsStateChanged events!" in the output window.
