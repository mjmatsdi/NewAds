    Ads Error: 1 : [AdsClient:TwinCAT.Ads.Internal.INotificationReceiver.OnNotificationError()] 
    Exception: Couldn't register for AdsState change Notifications on the connected ADS Server. 
    Don't register for AdsClient.AdsStateChanged events! (Target port could not be found. 
    (AdsErrorCode: 6, 0x6))
    ...
    Exception thrown: 'TwinCAT.Ads.AdsErrorException' in TwinCAT.Ads.dll
    The program '[6684] NewAds.exe' has exited with code 0 (0x0).

the first part (Ads Error 1...) did not throw an exception when I stepped thru the code.
The exception was thrown when I hit the "client.AddDeviceNotification("vMessages.Msgs_SCP.Ready",..." 
code.
