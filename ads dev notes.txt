When first starting the dev vm
-load eHub plc project - do NOT activate it or put it in RUN mode.
-run the NewAds console app
-result:
    Ads Error: 1 : [AdsClient:TwinCAT.Ads.Internal.INotificationReceiver.OnNotificationError()] 
    Exception: Couldn't register for AdsState change Notifications on the connected ADS Server. 
    Don't register for AdsClient.AdsStateChanged events! (Target port could not be found. 
    (AdsErrorCode: 6, 0x6))
    ...
    Exception thrown: 'TwinCAT.Ads.AdsErrorException' in TwinCAT.Ads.dll
    The program '[6684] NewAds.exe' has exited with code 0 (0x0).

the first part (Ads Error 1...) did not throw an exception when I stepped thru the code.
The exception was thrown when I hit the "client.AddDeviceNotification("vMessages.Msgs_SCP.Ready",..." 
code.


Try again with some code re-shuffling and a new invalid notification handler
When first starting the dev vm
-load eHub plc project - do NOT activate it or put it in RUN mode.
-run the NewAds console app
-result: on the line where I ask for the Ads state (client.ReadState().AdsState) it throws
    Exception thrown: 'TwinCAT.Ads.AdsErrorException' in TwinCAT.Ads.dll
    Target port could not be found.
reading the ads state occurs immediately after the Ads.Connect call

repeating the above but activating the project and loading it and running it, I don't get that
"Don't register for AdsClient.AdsStateChanged events!" in the output window.

Running PLC app. Running Ads app. 
Ads has seen messages.
Open plc program, edit it, login with on-line change
no indication that the plc ads state has changed.
ask plc to create more msgs
msgs recvd by the ads app
I was expecting some sort of exception. guess not.

repeating the above but this time with "Login with download"
got this in the debugger:
    AdsStateChanged(Stop)
    Client_AdsNotificationsInvalidated()
    Exception thrown: 'TwinCAT.Ads.AdsErrorException' in TwinCAT.Ads.dll
    The program '[10068] NewAds.exe' has exited with code 0 (0x0).
got this on the apps console:
    Ads was NOT happy: Key could not be found in hashtable


repeating the above
    I think it faulted when I try to DeleteDeviceNotification(notificationHandle)
    I think bc it's 0. Added Trace statements to verify
Login with download and all this happened:
    AdsStateChanged(Stop)
    Client_AdsNotificationsInvalidated()
    Inner while loop exited.
        AdsIsRunning = False
        notificationHandle = 0
    Inner while loop exited.
        AdsIsRunning = False
        notificationHandle = 3
    Inner while loop exited.
        AdsIsRunning = False
        notificationHandle = 4
    Inner while loop exited.
        AdsIsRunning = False
        notificationHandle = 5
    Inner while loop exited.
        AdsIsRunning = False
        notificationHandle = 6
    Inner while loop exited.
        AdsIsRunning = False
        notificationHandle = 7
    Inner while loop exited.
        AdsIsRunning = False
        notificationHandle = 8
    Inner while loop exited.
        AdsIsRunning = False
        notificationHandle = 9
    Client_AdsNotification()
    Inner while loop exited.
        AdsIsRunning = False
        notificationHandle = 10
    Inner while loop exited.
        AdsIsRunning = False
        notificationHandle = 11
    Inner while loop exited.
        AdsIsRunning = False
        notificationHandle = 12
At this point I exited the program because I wanted to log all this down

Reran the above. But this time:
After Login with download I hit play on the plc program to let it run again.
then I asked it to start making msgs again.
Exception!
Here's the debugger:
    AdsStateChanged(Run)        -- this is when I hit play
    Client_AdsNotification()
    Client_AdsNotification()
    Exception thrown: 'TwinCAT.Ads.AdsErrorException' in TwinCAT.Ads.dll
    exception when processing sending buffer    -- this is in the handle tag change - or is it.
    Client_AdsNotification()
    Client_AdsNotification()
    Exception thrown: 'TwinCAT.Ads.AdsErrorException' in TwinCAT.Ads.dll
    exception when processing sending buffer
    Exception thrown: 'TwinCAT.Ads.AdsErrorException' in TwinCAT.Ads.dll
    An exception of type 'TwinCAT.Ads.AdsErrorException' occurred in TwinCAT.Ads.dll but was not handled in user code
    Symbol version is invalid. (AdsErrorCode: 1809, 0x711)
Not sure why I got 4 AdsNotification events with an exception in the middle and then another after.
I'm starting to wonder if the AdsNotification covers more than just a tag change.
